# Dart-Project
Create a simple dart console program that accepts a user's jamb result, collates the results, then displays it to the user in a nice and simple format.


The inputs to be accepted are:
Full name
Jamb Registration number (must be 10 characters long with the first 8 characters as numbers and the remaining two as letters. Anything other than this is not allowed)
The four subjects the user sat for
The equivalent scores to those subjects
when the program is collating the result, simulate a delay of 3 seconds, then display "Loading..." or "Collating...", etc to the user
